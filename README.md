# Frontend Mentor - Order Summary Card Solution

This is my solution for the [Order Summary Card challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/order-summary-component-QlPmajDUj) on Frontend Mentor.

## Overview

### The Challenge

The challenge was to build out an order summary card component and make it look as close to the design as possible. Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements.

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I Learned

While building this project, I got better at:

- Structuring HTML for components.
- Using CSS for layout with Flexbox.
- Creating hover effects for interactive elements.

### Continued Development

In the future, Iâ€™d like to:

- Improve the responsiveness further.
- Experiment with animations for hover states.
